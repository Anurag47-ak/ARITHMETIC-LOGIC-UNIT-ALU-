-----DESCRIPTION----

Objective:
The main goal of this task was to design a simple 4-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) using Verilog. The ALU was supposed to perform five basic operations — addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, and NOT. I had to write the code for the ALU, create a testbench to verify its working, and generate simulation results to check if it was working as expected.

Introduction:
An ALU is one of the most important components in any digital system or processor. It is the part that handles all the arithmetic and logical operations. Since I am just getting started with VLSI design and HDL coding, this was a great opportunity to understand how a basic ALU works internally and how to build one using Verilog.
This task helped me get hands-on experience with digital design, use of behavioral modeling, and how to write and test Verilog code in a simulator.

Design Details:
I designed the ALU in such a way that it takes two 4-bit inputs `A` and `B`, and based on a 3-bit control signal `sel`, it performs one of the following operations:

| Operation   | Control Input (`sel`) |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Addition    | `000`                 |
| Subtraction | `001`                 |
| Bitwise AND | `010`                 |
| Bitwise OR  | `011`                 |
| Bitwise NOT | `100` (only on A)     |

The output is stored in a 4-bit register called `result`. I used a `case` statement inside an `always` block to select the operation depending on the value of `sel`.

Verilog Code:

```verilog
module ALU (
    input [3:0] A,
    input [3:0] B,
    input [2:0] sel,
    output reg [3:0] result
);

always @(*) begin
    case (sel)
        3'b000: result = A + B;
        3'b001: result = A - B;
        3'b010: result = A & B;
        3'b011: result = A | B;
        3'b100: result = ~A;
        default: result = 4'b0000;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

Testbench and Simulation:
To check whether my ALU was working correctly, I wrote a testbench that applied different inputs to `A`, `B`, and `sel`. I also added `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars` commands to generate waveform outputs.
Here's the testbench I wrote:

```verilog
module ALU_tb;

reg [3:0] A, B;
reg [2:0] sel;
wire [3:0] result;

ALU uut (
    .A(A),
    .B(B),
    .sel(sel),
    .result(result)
);

initial begin
    $dumpfile("wave.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, ALU_tb);

    A = 4'b0101; B = 4'b0011; sel = 3'b000; #10; // Addition
    sel = 3'b001; #10;                          // Subtraction
    sel = 3'b010; #10;                          // AND
    sel = 3'b011; #10;                          // OR
    sel = 3'b100; #10;                          // NOT

    $finish;
end

endmodule
```

Simulation Results:

I used an online simulator and also tried local tools like Icarus Verilog + GTKWave to check the waveform outputs. The simulation results confirmed that each operation was giving the expected result. Here's a table of what I observed:

| Operation   | A    | B    | Result |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| Addition    | 0101 | 0011 | 1000   |
| Subtraction | 0101 | 0011 | 0010   |
| AND         | 0101 | 0011 | 0001   |
| OR          | 0101 | 0011 | 0111   |
| NOT (on A)  | 0101 | —    | 1010   |

The results matched the expected binary outputs perfectly, which confirmed that my ALU was working correctly for all the operations.

Conclusion:
This was my first real digital design task using Verilog, and I learned a lot from it. I got to understand how ALUs work at a hardware level and how to write clean and testable Verilog code. I also learned how to write a testbench and simulate my design to verify its functionality. This task was a great starting point and I am excited to take on more complex designs in the coming weeks of my internship.
